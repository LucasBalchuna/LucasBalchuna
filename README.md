Hello!! ^^ 
My name is Lucas Balchuna (@LucasBalchuna), im degree in Analysis and System Development and working with Data engineering and Software engineering.

Working with development of ETL/ELT, Python, AWS and Salesforce DataCloud. 

Currently I have dedicated myself to constantly learning Python and AWS with concepts of Big Data, Data Analysis, frameworks like PySpark and more of i called of the "✨Wonderful Data World✨". 

Also dedicate myself to learn a little about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, frameworks like Angular and ways to integrate this in frontend with python in backend.
Sometime, in my free time i like to make some data analyse with Jupyter to practice what i learned in my study time.

But, like a pokemon evolution, in my laisure time i like to play videogames, watch a movies and series, play something with my friends or just talk in Discord and play violin (and... my musical taste is very ecletical and a little doubtful lol).
